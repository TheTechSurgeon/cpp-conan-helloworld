#  C++ Conan hello world example

Build steps to follow: 

## Open a terminal using VSCode devcontainers
    ./build.sh


If you have never used devcontainers in VSCode, it's the BEST thing ever you can develop code on your machine without installing it's SDK. 

This template demonstrates how to build and execute a C++ program inside a container.

All the C++ related VSCode extensions are defined in the [`devcontainer.json`](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file and are automatically installed with the container.

## How to use it

You need to have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed on your computer.
