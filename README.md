# VSCode Containerized Development: C++ with CMake and Conan

This template demonstrates how to build and execute a C++ program inside a container.

All the C++ related extensions are defined in the [`devcontainer.json`](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file and are automatically installed with the container.

You need to have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed on your computer.
